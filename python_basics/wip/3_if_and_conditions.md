# Lesson 3: If-Statements

## Introduction
If-statements allow us to add another level of decision making to our programs. They run certain blocks of code *if* a *condition* is met.

This decision making is super important to making good programs. For example:
- *If* the password is correct, *then* allow access.
- *If* Mario falls out of the world, *then* remove 1 from the life count.
- *If* Alice's number is higher, *then* give her a point, *otherwise* give Bob a point.

What other if-then or if-then-otherwise sentences can you come up with?
